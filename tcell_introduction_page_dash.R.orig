  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
  Here, you can explore the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) results from wild type (WT) and β2 integrin-deficient (CD18 Knock-out[KO]) gamma delta (γδ) T cells isolated from mice lungs.
  <p>
  
  <p>
  The analysis was carried out using the Seurat pipeline for differential expression. Further details can be found in our paper summarized below which you should cite if you use our data.

    <h4>Paper significance statement</h4>
    <p>γδ T cells reside in barrier tissues and provide immune protection against infection and cancer. Their anti-tumor potential has
    led to recent advances in the development of γδ T cell immunotherapy. However, our understanding of the basic biology of these 
    cells, including what molecules and pathways control their maintenance within barrier tissues, remains poor. We demonstrate that
    β2 integrin adhesion molecules play a major role in regulating γδ T cell subset numbers during homeostasis: the loss of β2 integrin
    expression results in a striking increase in IL17-producing γδ T cells in the lungs and uterus due to enhanced survival. These 
    findings illustrate a novel mechanism of γδ T cell regulation that may have significant implications for immunotherapy development.
